> The idea is to create a mobile app that would help people to find new movies to watch or discuss ones they have already seen. There users would have an ability to create lists from movies, cartoons, etc. -they watched, read reviews and choose something new to watch, discuss movies with friends without being afraid to spoil something because users will be able to see their friends' movie-list and plans for watching soon.

This project uses Material Design principles with help of the KivyMD library and consists of two parts: user side and server side as well. Mobile app connects the server by using socket and json libraries for Python. Databases are performed by ".json" files as well.
